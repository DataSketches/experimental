/**
 * The Count-Min sketch of Cormode and Muthukrishnan is useful for approximately answering point queries, i.e.,
 * queries of the form "what is the frequency of key i"? It can also answer other queries as well
 * (range queries, inner product queries, heavy hitters, quantiles, etc.), though it incurs significant
 * overheads for some of these other queries.
 * 
 * The Count-Min algorithm can process deletion of items as well as insertions, since it is a linear sketch.
 * However, using Count-Min to return frequent items in the presence of deletions requires significant overhead.
 * To avoid this overhead, this class only answers point queries; it does have a function for returning frequent
 * items. This class can process deletions as well as insertions. 
 * 
 * This implementation also supports the Conservative Update rule proposed by Estan and Varghese 
 * ("New Directions in Traffic Measurement and Accounting: Focusing on the Elephants, Ignoring the Mice"),
 * which can provide more accurate answers than the update rule in the basic Count-Min sketch.
