/**
 * Abstract class for a FrequencyEstimator algorithm. Supports the ability to process a data stream
 * of (item, increment) pairs, where item is an identifier, specified as a long, and increment is a
 * non-negative integer that is also specified as a long. The frequency of an identifier is defined
 * to be the sum of associated the increments. Any FrequencyEstimator algorithm must be able to: 1)
 * estimate the frequency of an identifier, 2) return upper and lower bounds on the frequency
 * (depending on the implementation, these bounds may hold deterministically, or with high
 * probability), 3) return an upper bound on the maximum error in any estimate (which also might
 * hold deterministically or with high probability, depending on implementation) 4) Return an array
 * of keys whose frequencies might be above a certain threshold (specifically, the threshold is
 * 1/errorTolerance + 1) 5) merge itself with another FrequencyEstimator algorithm from the same
 * instantiation of the abstract class.
