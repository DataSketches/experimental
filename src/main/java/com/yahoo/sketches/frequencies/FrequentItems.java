/**
 * The frequent-items sketch is useful for keeping approximate counters for keys (map from key (long) to value (long)).  
 * The sketch is initialized with a maximal size parameter. The sketch will keep at most that number of positive counters at any given time.
 * When the sketch is updated with a key, the corresponding counter is incremented by 1 or, if there is no counter for that key, a new counter is created. 
 * If the sketch reaches its maximal allowed size, it removes some counter and decrements other.
 * The logic of the frequent-items sketch is such that the stored counts and real counts are never too different.
 * More explicitly 
 * 1) The estimate from the sketch is never larger than the real count
 * 2) The estimate from the sketch is never smaller than the real count minus the guaranteed error
 * 3) The guaranteed error is at most the number of updates to sketch divided by its maximal size.
 * 
 * Background:
 * The algorithm is most commonly known as the "Misra-Gries algorithm", "frequent items" or "space-saving". 
 * It was discovered and rediscovered and redesigned several times over the years.
