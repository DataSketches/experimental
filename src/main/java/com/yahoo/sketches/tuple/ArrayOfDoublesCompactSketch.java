 * Top level for compact sketches. Compact sketches are never created directly.
 * They are created as a result of the compact() method on a QuickSelectSketch
 * or the getResult() method of a set operation like Union, Intersection or AnotB.
 * Compact sketch consists of a compact list (i.e. no intervening spaces) of hash values,
 * corresponding list of double values, and a value for theta. The lists may or may
 * not be ordered. Compact sketch is read-only.
